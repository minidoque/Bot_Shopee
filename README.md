# Bot_Shopee

This is a flash sale bot forked from IkanPakUs' repo. It's still kind of manual at the moment, but I'll try my best to actually configure something that's easy to use (if I feel like it.)

How to use:
1. Clone this repo
2. Config checkout-shopee to adjust the link of item you want to buy and also the date of said flash sale.
3. Run program with `python shopeebot.py`
4. In the browser that's popped up, use qr code to login to your account.
5. Wait until timer gets to 0.
6. ...
7. Profit!
